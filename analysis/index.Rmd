Welcome to the website summarising the soybean R-gene analysis.


0. EDA of PAV and different classes: [link](eda.html)

1. Plotting of NBS/RLK/RLP plots based on total numbers: [link](total_numbers.html). These results are the main part of the paper.

3. Linking yield with NLR gene counts using regular lm(): [link](yield_lm_link.html). These results are the main part of the paper.


# DIRECTOR'S CUT

1. Plotting of NBS/RLK/RLP plots based on percentage lost: [link](first-analysis.html). These results are mostly not in the paper.

2. Linking yield with NLR gene counts using lme4: [link](yield_link.html). These results are not in the paper, but informed the main part.
